A script that simply does what you'd get when using the tar utility.
Why?
Just wanted to learn a couple of things in Python:
	Logging
	Exceptions
	Using tarfile
	Using os.path

*** IMPORTANT ***
The script writes its log information to a hard-coded path in my home directory
You should change that if you want to test it.
